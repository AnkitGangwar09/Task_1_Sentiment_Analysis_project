# Sentiment_Analysis_project
Sentiment analysis system is a project from field of NLP.
It is a machine learning and natural language processing (NLP) endeavor that focuses on predicting the sentiment of tweets related to US airlines. The dataset consists of over 14,000 tweets, and the goal is to classify each tweet as either positive, negative, or neutral based on its sentiment.

# Project Objectives
Sentiment Classification: The primary objective of this project is to develop a machine learning model capable of accurately classifying tweets into one of three sentiment categories: positive, negative, or neutral. This classification can provide valuable insights into customer opinions and sentiments regarding US airlines. NLP Techniques: The project serves as an opportunity to apply various natural language processing techniques, such as text preprocessing, feature extraction, and sentiment analysis, to real-world data. Model Evaluation: Extensive model evaluation will be performed to assess the accuracy and performance of the sentiment classification models. Metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score will be considered to measure the model's effectiveness. Model Selection: Different machine learning and NLP models, including but not limited to logistic regression, random forest, and deep learning models, may be experimented with to find the most effective approach for sentiment classification.

# project Conclusion
Upon completion, the project is expected to deliver the following outcomes: A well-trained sentiment analysis model capable of accurately classifying tweets into positive, negative, or neutral categories. Documentation detailing the steps taken, algorithms employed, and results achieved throughout the project.
